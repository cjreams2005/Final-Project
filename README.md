# Final-Project-CMPINF-0010

We're looking to find the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh for going on relaxing walks together while having a good yap (fufilling conversations). In order to find the best neighborhood for taking a chill walk, we have decided on three metrics: air quality, trees, and park features. Air quality and trees tie together for creating a refreshing outside environment that allows for fresh air during walks. Park features allows for more fun and recreational activities to stop by and possibly have fun with during walks.
